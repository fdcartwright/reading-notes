# Operators & Loops

## Operators
Comparison operators evaluate a situation by comparing the values usually true or false.

== is equal to
!= is not equal to
=== strict equal
!== strict not equal
> greater than
< less than
>= great or equal
<=less or equal

Local operators allow the comparison of multiple operators.

(Value < value) && (value >= value)

&& and
|| or
! Not 

## for & while loops
Loops check a condition and if true, a code block will run. If still true, it will run again. This repeats until the condition is returned false. 

For loop - for running code a specific number of times. Usually the loop is a counter for how many times.

While loop - if you donâ€™t know how many times. 

Do while - very similar to while loop, the main difference being it always runs the statements inside the curly braces at least once. 

For (var i = 0, I < 10; I++) {
	document.write(I);
}
