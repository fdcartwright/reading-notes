Width and height attributes can be used to adjust the image size.

Image should be saved in jpeg, gif, or png formats. Jpeg for many different colors and gif or png with few colors or areas of the same color. These images should always be saved using px for size.

## Color
CSS makes a website attractive by adding color, design, and layout.

You can add color to your foreground or background by using RGB values, HEX codes, or color names. It is good practice to add comments for the color specification. Once color is determined, you can adjust Hue, Saturation, and Brightness.

Contrast and opacity are important for the readability of the website. Text is more difficult to read with low contrast. It can also be harder to view with poor monitor quality or sunlight. Opacity can be adjusted from 0.0 - 1.0. You can also adjust color opacity using the same color code variations.

## Text
