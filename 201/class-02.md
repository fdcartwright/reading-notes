# HTML Text, CSS Intro, Basic .JS

## HTML Text
Coding a website uses markup tags to provide meaning. The different kind of markup tags are; structural markup (elements for headings and paragraphs) and semantic markup (the extra info that show emphasis on the sentence). 

There are six levels of h1 headers, each progressively getting small in size. Paragraphs are created using the open and close p and are placed on a new line for each. 

A short list:

\<h1> = header
\<p> = paraghraph
\<b> = bold
\<i> = italic
\<br> = break
<strong> = importance

## HTML Intro CSS
CSS makes a website attractive by adding color, design, and layout. CSS allows for rules that direct how content will look. 

Block level elements start a new line and stack to make sections. Inline elements control the text and do not start a new line.

External CSS can be used with the link element and direct to the .CSS page(s). You can also use internal inline CSS using the style element. 

Rules are made with selectors and declarations that can be targeted at different elements. 

## Basic .JS
JavaScript is made up of instructions for a computer using statements. The statements should start a new line and end with a semicolon in order to make the code easier to follow and read. The statements have curly brackets that define the code block.

Comments should be used to help others viewing the code quickly understand what is happening and making the code easier to read.

Variables store declared information temporarily until it is to be used in the script. An example would be a math equation and providing and answer. Arrays are variable that can store multiple pieces of information. 

## .JS Decisions & Loops
There are three concepts for determining a path of action.

Evaluations - looking at values to decide if they match the expected result.

Decisions - evaluations to determine the path the script should take.

Loops - used to repeat the steps.

Comparison operators are used in the code to compare multiple operands. Included in this are Logical operators that compare multiple operators.

With the if else statements, the code can perform the initial set of code and if the condition is true or false, is directed to the next code as designed.
