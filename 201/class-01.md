HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a markup language and "foundation" of a website. 

### Structure, Process, & Design

### Extra Markup
Extra markup is an important addition to the website as this provides for older HTML to work with HTML5, declaring the DOCTYPE, additing comments in the code, attributes such as class and id.
