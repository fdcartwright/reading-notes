# Read03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## HTML Lists

Webpages have three different types of lists:

Ordered list (ol) - all items are listed with a number. Indented by default. Each list item is place in a li tag within the ol.

Unordered list (ul) - all items are listed with a bullet point.  Indented by default. Each list item is place in a li tag within the ul.


Definition list (dl) - listed with a term and definition.  Each definition is placed in a dt tag within the dl tag. You can place two terms for one definition. 

## HTML Boxes

CSS treats each element as it is inside of boxes. 

Box dimensions are defaulted just big enough for the content. To increase the box size, height and width can be used with px ,% ,or em.

% = box size is relative to the browser window

Em = box size is based off the text size within the box

Px = is the pixel size chosen.

Limiting width (min/max), limiting (min/mx) height, expand and shrink to fit the size of the users screen. This is used to make sure content is legible on all screen sizes.

Overflow is used for controlling content that does not fit in the box. This tells the browser what to do with this content with hidden and scroll properties. 

A nested list is a list within a list. This would be ul, li, ul, li for example.

Boxes have three properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance. These are border, margin (outside of border), and padding (inside the box, between the content).

## .JS Instruction, Decisions, Loops

An arrary is a variable that can store a list of values. Arrays are created just like variables although, after the equals, there are square brackets with values listed. Value in the array are accessed liked a numbered list starting a index position 0. .length represents the entire array list, even new add values. 

If/else statements = used to conditionalize multiple variables and responses.

Switch statements - these are used if there is a default option that is run if none of the cases match.

Used for conditional logic 
Truthy vs falsey = almost true (acceptable).
Truthy = ie true, tubers 1 or more, strings with values, string ‘0’, negative numbers
Falsey = number 0, null, empty string ‘ ‘, undefined, false, NaN
NaN = not a number
Booleans = true or false

A way to get our code to run more than once, without having to write again.

While loop - while a condition is truthy, run the following code over and over again. Will only run code under, once falsey.

do while - use to run at least once. Will always run at least once.
