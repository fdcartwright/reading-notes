Reading 04 # HTML Links, JS Functions, CSS Layout

## HTML Links
The \<a>a element is what defines a link. This added with the href attribute the tell the page what is being linked. Linking to a page within the site should be done with relative links vs urls. 

## Html Layout
Layout controls the elements position on the page and makes the page more attractive. 

Each element starts in a block-level position and can be placed in an inline position. Elements can be contained as inline elements inside of block-level elements. This would be accomplished using a div. 

There are multiple schemes for positioning elements.

Normal flow - every block level element appears on a new line. This is the default.

Relative positioning - this takes from default and moves it without affecting the surrounding elements.

Absolute positioning - This is taken out of normal flow  and does not affect the surrounding elements. They simply ignore the space it would have taken.

Fixed positioning - This is a form of absolute that positions in relation to the browser vs other elements. 

Floating elements - The takes the element out of normal flow and to right or left of box. This becomes a block-level element.


## .JS Functions, Methods, Objects 86-99
JavaScript is organized into functions, methods, and objects.

Functions - These consist of a series of statements that are grouped together to perform a task. These group a series of statements to preform a specific task. Functions can be reusable to repeat the same script task.

Functions need names in order to be “called” to perform a task or invoked. Some functions need information or parameters in order to achieve the requested task. In order to provide an answer, the function needs a return value. 

Function scope is known as local or global scope. Local being within the function and can only be used for that function and global scope being outside the function and can be used anywhere in the script.

Methods - These match functions however, these are created inside an object

Objects - These are made up of properties and methods. Built-in objects 

## Reasons for pair programming

Pair programming requires two roles, a driver (the person writing the code) and the navigator (the person directing/guiding the code). With programming method, developers explain the code, listen, read, and write the code. This provides a stronger learning experience and better code.
