# Markdown

## Markdown is a quick and easy way to create and style text on a webpage. Start by creating a heading using the # symbol plus your text(# = h1, ## = h2, or ### for h3). After creating your heading you will begin filling your website with paragraphs and/or ordered(1. 2. 3.)/unordered(* or -)lists.
