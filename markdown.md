# Markdown

Markdown is a quick and easy way to create and style text on a webpage. Start by creating a heading using the # symbol plus your text(# = h1, ## = h2, or ### for h3). After creating your heading you will begin filling your website with paragraphs and/or ordered(1. 2. 3.)/unordered(* or -)lists. Have some fun with markdown by adding a photo using ![Photo Description](URL/location HERE) or a link [Link text](link URL/location).
