# Design with CSS

## Color with CSS
CSS makes a website attractive by adding color, design, and layout. 

## Choosing colors
You can add color to your foreground or background by using RGB values, HEX codes, or color names. It is good practice to add comments for the color specification. Once color is determined, you can adjust Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. 

## Contrast & Opacity
Contrast and opacity are important for the readability of the website. Text is more difficult to read with low contrast. It can also be harder to view with poor monitor quality or sunlight. Opacity can be adjusted from 0.0 - 1.0. You can also adjust color opacity using the same color code variations.
