# 06 read Problem Domain Objects and the DOM

## Object Literals 
Objects are a group of variable know as properties and functions know as methods to make something recognizable in the real world. 

Literal notation objects are the easiest and most popular. This is achieved by first naming the object. Secondly, the content is added and a method (function) can be added as well. Accessing a property or properties, use the object name followed by the method name. If the method name need parameters, they can be added in parentheses. 

## Document Object Model 183-242

DOM details how the browser should create the HTML page and how .JS can  access and update the content. The DOM is not HTML or .JS, it is a separate set of rules. The DOM is also referred to as an API (Application Programming Interface). 

DOM trees have four types of nodes; document, elements, attribute, and text. Element nodes are selected with id or class. From here, the element content can be updated using properties textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation.
