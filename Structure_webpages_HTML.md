# Structure Webpages in HTML

## HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a markup language and "foundation" of a website. 

## Structure, Process, & Design
Planning process and design is an important step in creating a website. This step looks at who the audience is, why they will visit your site, how much traffic the site will receive, the layout (pages, content), and flow. 

## Layout
Layout of the website is important for readability, organization, and search engine weight. Older HTML overused div tags that made the code hard to read compared to the new HTML5 code. 

## Extra Markup
Extra markup is an important addition to the website as this provides for older HTML to work with HTML5, declaring the DOCTYPE, additing comments in the code, attributes such as class and id.
